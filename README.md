I made this project by using python programming language, where i used python OpenCV library and YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is an advanced deep learning model specifically designed for fast and accurate object detection.<br> 
This project is about creating a real-time object detection system that can identify and label objects in a live video feed from a webcam.<br>
Using advanced computer vision techniques, the system detects objects and displays them on the screen with labels, making it useful for a variety of applications such as security, automation, and interactive systems.
